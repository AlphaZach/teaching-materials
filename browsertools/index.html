      <h1>JS202 JS DOM Browser Tools</h1>
      <br><br>
      
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This class is a hands-on and follow-along class, so be prepared to follow along with your browser tools. This class is designed around Google Chrome, but the tools we learn today can easily be applied to other browsers. For ease of following along however, please use Google Chrome.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Start by opening your Chrome Developer Tools by doing any of the following
          <ul>
            <li>Select the Chrome menu Chrome Menu at the top-right of your browser window, then select Tools > Developer Tools.</li>
            <li>Right-click on any page element and select Inspect Element.</li>
            <li>Pressing Alt + Cmd + i</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>On your worksheet, take note of the different panes we'll be covering. <strong>Use the elements pane to add those names to <a href="worksheet.html" target="blank">the HTML version of the worksheet</a></strong></li>
      </ol>
      <h2>The Elements Pane</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Click on the Elements pane, and let's begin exploring examples.</li>
        <li>Using the elements pane, add a success label to the end of this <code>li</code> tag. Use this HTML: <code> &lt;span class="label label-success"&gt;Success&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
        <li>After the node appears, right click on the HTML in the elements pane for the label you just added. Select "delete node" and watch what happens.</li>
        <li style="font-size:xx-large">This text is far too large. Fix it using the CSS menu in the elements pane to un-check the box.</li>
        <li>Using the elements pane, add an image that floats to the right of this list.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>The Network Tab</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open <a href="http://coursera.org" target="_blank">coursera.org</a> and open your Dev Tools. Navigate to the network tab.</li>
        <li>Click on the XHR filter, and refresh the page.</li>
        <li>Look at the headers, preview, response, cookies, and timing panes. The preview pane should provide an interactive json object you can look through for debugging.</li>
        <li>Take a look at the images filter as well, and note that not every image as a request issued for it if you have been to the page before.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The JS Console</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the JS console by clicking on the "Console" tab.</li>
        <li>Try typing the following and exploring the contents of each object:
          <ul>
            <li><code>window</code></li>
            <li><code>document</code></li>
            <li><code>console</code></li>
            <li><code>chrome</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <h2>The Debugger</h2>
        <li>Open <a href="exercises/laundry_timer.html" target="blank">The Laundry Timer.</a></li>
        <li>Take a look at the bugs on the laundry timer. These problems need to be fixed, let's walk through the first one using the Debugger</li>
        <li>Open Dev Tools, and navigate to the Sources tab, on the laundry timer page. You should see on the left-hand side, a pane with a list of files. Click on laundry_timer.html.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to line 68, the first line of the event listener for the "New Washer Load" button. Click directly on the line number to add a breakpoint.</li>
        <li>Enter some numbers, then click the "New Washer Load" button. You'll notice that the page is now grey and the javascript has stopped running.</li>
        <li>Pay special attention to the right-hand side of the Dev Tools window. Click on the "Step Into" button (arrow pointing down) and watch as the local scope window fills up with all of the variables we see being defined. We can see their values.</li>
        <li>Now, add a breakpoint to the dryer button's event handler.</li>
        <li>Do you see any difference between the variables we saw in the washer, and the ones we saw in the dryer? </li>
        <li>Can you see what is happening differently between the washer and dryer code?</li>
        <li>Set a breakpoint on "DOM Mutation" in the "Event Listener Breakpoints" pane on the right hand side, then try to trigger it.</li>

        <li>Use the debugger to find the rest of the bugs, and then modify the original file (outside of Dev Tools) to fix them</li>
        <li><strong>HINT:</strong> Set a watch expression on line 115, for the expression <code>counterTDs[i].innerHTML.split(":")[1]</code></li>
